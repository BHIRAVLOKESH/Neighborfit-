NeighborFit Project Assignment
Project Brief
Build a full-stack web application that solves the neighborhood-lifestyle
matching problem through systematic research, data analysis, and algorithmic
thinking.
Core Requirements
Problem Analysis & Research (50% of grade)
Identify and define the core problem through user research
Analyze existing solutions and their gaps
Develop hypotheses about user behavior and test them
Use data to validate or invalidate your assumptions
Technical Problem-Solving (40% of grade)
Design and implement a matching algorithm
Handle real-world data collection and processing challenges
Build scalable data structures and APIs
Solve integration challenges with external data sources
Systems Thinking (10% of grade)
Document trade-offs and decision rationale
Demonstrate understanding of scalability constraints
Show systematic approach to complex problem decomposition
Constraints & Problem Parameters
Resource Constraints
Zero budget - solve using only free resources
2-week timeline - scope appropriately
Limited data access - be creative with data acquisition
Technical Constraints
Must work with real neighborhood data
Must be functional (not just mockups)
Must handle edge cases and data inconsistencies

Deliverables
Technical Implementation
Functional application with working algorithm
Data processing pipeline (however basic)
Source code with clear problem-solving documentation
Problem-Solving Documentation
Problem definition and hypothesis formation
Research methodology and findings analysis
Algorithm design rationale and trade-offs
Data challenges encountered and solutions implemented
